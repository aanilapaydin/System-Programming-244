NAME
       DOMATH -  doMath is the server that calculate polynomical and trigonometric functions include sin,cos,exp
		 that fiven respond nanoseconds time.it only run with client program.
       CLIENT -  client is the program that acts client,connects doMath server and command intergate or derivate
		 servers function in that given time differance in miliseconds

SYNOPSIS
       running server:
	    ./doMath [*FUNCTION] [RESPOND TIME (NANOSECONDS)] 
	
	* = with blank between each arg and at blank last.

       connecting server:
	    ./client [INTEGRAL-DERIVATE] [TIME DIFFRENCE (MILISECONDS)]

DESCRIPTION
       doMath server takes and function from command line convert to postfix and according to the client response
       calculates integral or derivation of the function in given response time.
