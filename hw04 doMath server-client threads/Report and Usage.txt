NAME
       DOMATH -  doMath is the server that calculate polynomical and trigonometric functions include sin,cos,exp
		 that fiven respond nanoseconds time wtih threads.it only run with client program.
       CLIENT -  client is the program that acts client,connects doMath server and command intergate or derivate
		 servers function in that given time differance in miliseconds



SYNOPSIS
       running server:
	    ./doMath [*FUNCTION] [RESPOND TIME (NANOSECONDS)] 
	
	* = with blank between each arg and at blank last.

       connecting server:
	    ./client [INTEGRAL-DERIVATE] [TIME DIFFRENCE (MILISECONDS)]




DESCRIPTION
       doMath server takes and function from command line convert to postfix and according to the client response
       calculates integral or derivation of the function in given response time.





****COMPILING****

gcc -c client.c
gcc -o client client.o -lm -lrt -lpthread
gcc -c doMath.c
gcc -o doMath doMath.o -lm -lrt -lpthread

***NOTE***:And also there is MAKEFILE in the file
	   You can compile with make command in terminal 




****EXAMPLE USAGE****

./doMath "sin ( t ^ 5 ) + t " 100000
./client integral 10

	or

./doMath "t ^ 3 " 1000000000
./client derivate 20000



***NOTE***: You must write function with blank between arguments,
	    operators,parantesis and function's end.
